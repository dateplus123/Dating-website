AngularJS  Practice Webpage.

Webpage that lists various movie titles and metadata on the screen. Using AngularJS (>1.5), and no jQuery, 
Purpose:  IT 219  Project # 3


For the project, I have edited:
/index.html
/css/style.css
/js/controllers/HomeController.js

Used the following:
ng-repeat
ng-href
ng-click
data binding
custom filter

//////
Leave the index.php file alone. It is used to make sure your Heroku server deploys correctly with PHP functionality and also automatically redirects visitors to index.html.
